# Troubleshooting: UE attach failure

The UE never completes RRC connection + Initial Context Setup — no `UE created`,
no `rrcSetupComplete`, or the `"Initial Context Setup Routine"` never reaches
`finished successfully`.

For the **expected message sequence** (the 31 steps this walks against), see
`../reference/ue-attach.md`. This doc is the failure dispatch: find the last step
that happened, then the first that didn't.

## Boundary vs. fallback scheduling

A missing `rrcSetupComplete` has two distinct causes — split on whether Msg4 was
ever emitted:

- **MSG4 / ConRes never *scheduled*** (no `CON_RES` DL PDU; `ra-ContentionResolutionTimer`
  expires) → the fallback scheduler never got the grant out → **not here**, go to
  `ue-fallback-scheduling-issues.md`.
- **MSG4 was scheduled + ACKed but the UE never replied**, or the attach broke at
  PRACH / NGAP-auth / security / ICS → **this doc**.

## Failure markers

| Where it fails | Marker | Likely cause |
|---|---|---|
| Before step 1 | PRACH not detected at all | UE TX power / SSB alignment / wrong `prach_config_index` → `phy-issues.md` |
| Step 1 → 6 | MSG3 doesn't decode (`crc=KO` on PUSCH for that rnti) | Power / timing / wrong MSG3 grant params → `phy-issues.md` |
| Step 6 missing (MSG4/ConRes never scheduled) | UE created but no `CON_RES` DL PDU; `ra-ContentionResolutionTimer` expires | Fallback scheduling → `ue-fallback-scheduling-issues.md` |
| Step 8 missing | `InitialULRRCMessageTransfer` arrived but `UE created` not logged | CU-CP rejected the UE — check warnings; could be `max_nof_ues` hit |
| Step 11 missing (but Msg4 was sent) | `rrcSetupComplete` never seen | UE didn't decode/ACK Msg4, or NAS PDU encoding failed (UE/UL side) |
| Step 15 missing | NAS exchange stalls between RRC and `InitialContextSetupRequest` | AMF auth failure (check `amf_ue` ID transition), 5GC issue |
| Step 30 missing | `"Initial Context Setup Routine"` logged `initialized` but never `finished successfully` | UE didn't reply to securityMode / Reconfiguration; or bearer setup failed in E1AP → `no-user-plane.md` |
| Step 31 then immediate UEContextRelease from AMF | NAS rejected the request | Check `cause` IE in `UEContextReleaseCommand` → `ue-release-issues.md` |

## Investigation checklist

1. Did PRACH happen?
   ```bash
   python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/ocudu/ocudu_log_search.py gnb.log --layer SCHED --pattern "prach\(" --count
   ```
2. Did the UE get a C-RNTI?
   ```bash
   python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/ocudu/ocudu_log_search.py gnb.log --pattern "UE created" --max-lines 20
   ```
3. Did rrcSetupComplete arrive?
   ```bash
   python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/ocudu/ocudu_log_search.py gnb.log --pattern "rrcSetupComplete" --max-lines 10
   ```
4. Was Initial Context Setup acknowledged?
   ```bash
   python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/ocudu/ocudu_log_search.py gnb.log --pattern '"Initial Context Setup Routine"' --max-lines 20
   ```
5. If a specific UE failed, scope everything by `c-rnti` and look at the gap:
   ```bash
   python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/ocudu/ocudu_log_search.py gnb.log --rnti <hex> --max-lines 200
   ```
6. Cross-correlate with the Amarisoft UE log via the `amari-ue` type — the
   UE log shows whether the UE actually decoded MSG4, whether it sent
   Reconfiguration Complete, and whether NAS Auth Response went out.

## Multi-UE specifics

In `multiue.attach_dettach.baseline` the gNB processes UEs in batches. The
`[SCHED] [W] UE creation (ue=N): latency1=...` and
`[MAC] [W] MAC UE creation (ue=N): ...` warnings are **expected diagnostic
output**, not real warnings — they report per-UE creation latency for
performance tracking.

When `Initial Context Setup OK : K/N` shows K < N, the gap is the most
useful single signal. Find which UEs missed it:

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/ocudu/ocudu_log_search.py gnb.log --pattern "UE created" \
    | grep -oE "ue=[0-9]+" | sort -u > /tmp/created.txt
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/ocudu/ocudu_log_search.py gnb.log --pattern '"Initial Context Setup Routine" finished' \
    | grep -oE "ue=[0-9]+" | sort -u > /tmp/done.txt
comm -23 /tmp/created.txt /tmp/done.txt
```
