# correlate — overview slot

Type-specific slot for the **overview** activity; the driving playbook pulls this
in. It is the cross-source layer added **on top of** the per-component summaries,
and the value-add of a whole-run overview: things no single artifact can see.

Read `cross-correlation.md` first if not already loaded.

## clock / slot alignment

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/correlate/align_clocks.py <run-dir>
```

Checks log↔pcap (expected Δ≈0 — same process) and UE↔gNB PHY slot alignment, and
distinguishes decode latency from genuine clock skew.

Off-host sources (VIAVI tester, remote 5GC, a UE sim on another box) may be
genuinely offset — surface a non-trivial Δ as an anomaly rather than silently
correcting for it. The `(SFN.slot, RNTI)` join does not depend on it.

## radio reconciliation (optional)

When the run has PHY-level data on both sides and the overview should state
whether the air interface was healthy:

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/correlate/correlate_radio.py <run-dir> --kind pusch
```

Reports rx-ok / rx-ko / missing / contention. Skip for a quick overview; include
when the per-component summaries already flagged PHY anomalies.

## cross-source block

Feeds the *Clocks*, *Cross-source picture* and *Anomalies* parts of the driving
playbook's consolidated block:

```
**Clocks:** all UTC; log↔pcap Δ <x> ms; UE↔gNB PHY slots aligned | offset <n> slots

### Cross-source picture
- Attach/release counts reconciled across UE ↔ gNB ↔ pcap
- Radio: <PUSCH rx-ok / rx-ko / contention, if correlate_radio.py was run>
- Timeline headline: first PRACH → attach → traffic → release
```

## cross-source anomalies

The ones worth calling out, because no single type can see them:

- UE reached REGISTERED but the gNB has no matching UE context (or vice-versa).
- pcap shows a release/cause the logs don't, or the counts disagree.
- gNB PUSCH `crc=KO` where the UE logged a transmission — a real decode issue, not
  UE DTX.
- Clock or PHY-slot misalignment reported by `align_clocks.py`.
- UE count vs gNB `UE created` count vs NGAP `InitialUEMessage` count disagree.
  For "how many UEs", use `amari-ue`'s cfg-derived count, **not** the testbed map's
  `amarisoft-ue-N` slot range (slots ≠ simulated UEs).

Count disagreement localises *where* UEs are lost — that pointer is the useful
output, not the raw tallies.
