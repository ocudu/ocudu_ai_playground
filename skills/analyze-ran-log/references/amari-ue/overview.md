# Amarisoft UE — overview slot

Type-specific slot for the **overview** activity; the driving playbook pulls
this in.

## inventory

Resolve already reported the run dir and which of `ue.log`, `stdout.log`,
`amarisoft_ue.cfg` are present.

## run summary script

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/amari-ue/ue_log_summary.py <run-dir>
```

Emits, in one pass:

- UE configuration (band, BW, UE count, IMSI, sim events)
- Run start/end time and duration
- UE software version and RF port info
- NAS state timeline (deduped, state changes only)
- Key RRC messages (setup, reconfigurations, reestablishments)
- Procedure counts: PRACH attempts, handovers, reestablishments, PHY CRC failures
- Traffic stats: CBR sent/received with loss percentage
- Sim events timeline (power_on, cbr_recv/cbr_send, power_off, quit)
- Anomalies (packet loss > 1%, PHY errors, unexpected final NAS state)

If the script is absent or fails, fall back to the grep recipes in
`reference/log-format.md`.

## stdout quick-scan

`stdout.log` is short — read it in full to capture:

- UE version
- RF port configuration (frequencies, bands)
- Cell(s) SIB found
- Final CBR stats

## Amarisoft UE Run Overview

**Path:** <run-dir>
**Test:**  <parent test dir name, if visible>

### Configuration
- UE count: N [single-UE | multi-UE]
- Band: nXX, BW: YY MHz
- Sim events: power_on → cbr_recv/send → power_off → quit
- UE version: <version>

### Timeline
- <time>  Started
- <time>  [UE 0001] 5GMM-REGISTERED CM-CONNECTED
- <time>  Handover (cell 00 → 01)     ← if any
- <time>  [UE 0001] 5GMM-NULL CM-IDLE
- <time>  Ended (duration: Xs)

### Procedures
- PRACH: N attempts
- Handovers: N
- Reestablishments: N
- PHY CRC failures: N

### Traffic
- DL: sent=N, recv=M (X.X% loss)
- UL: sent=N, recv=M (X.X% loss)

### Anomalies
- <bullet per anomaly, or "None">
