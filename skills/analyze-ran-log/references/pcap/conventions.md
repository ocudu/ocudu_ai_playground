# pcap conventions

Type-specific deltas for `pcap` artifacts. The shared resolve / efficiency /
memory flow lives in the skill `SKILL.md`; this file carries only what is
particular to Upper-PDU packet captures.

## Subtree layout

Debugging is symptom-first, so the procedure docs split by role (mirroring the
`ocudu` subtree):

- **`troubleshooting/`** — per-procedure failure playbooks (failure markers +
  tshark checklist) for random-access, registration, pdu-session-setup, handover,
  ue-context-release. Start here from a symptom; each cites the expected-sequence
  `reference/` doc it needs.
- **`reference/`** — lazily-loaded knowledge: the format ref (`pcap-format.md`),
  the tshark recipe index (`tshark-recipes.md`), cross-pcap correlation
  (`cross-pcap-correlation.md`), the per-protocol pcap-observation refs
  (`protocols/` — tshark filters + field tables for f1ap/e1ap/ngap/mac/rlc plus
  `general.md`), and the expected across-pcaps sequences + vocabulary for the
  procedures (sequence + cause-IE / trigger vocabulary **only**; failure markers
  live in the paired `troubleshooting/` doc).
- top level — the entry point (`conventions.md`) and the three activity slots
  (`overview.md`, `query.md`, `investigate.md`) that the mode playbooks pull from.

The `investigate.md` § symptom → playbook dispatch table maps each symptom
to the `troubleshooting/` doc to load.

## Resolve & scope

The dispatcher runs `scripts/pcap/resolve.py`, which — per target pcap —
checks it is non-empty, uses the Wireshark **Upper-PDU** (DLT 252) framing, and
binds a known 3GPP dissector (`ngap`/`f1ap`/`e1ap`/`mac-nr`/`rlc-nr`) on the
first frame. It prints the resolved kind, the sibling pcaps present, the tshark
version, and a per-file `OK`/`FAIL` line ending in `verdict: OK`/`BAIL`. **Bail
if the verdict is not OK** — a `FAIL` with an unexpected/missing dissector
usually means the Upper-PDU dispatcher needs `-d user_dlt 252,...`; document such
a case in `reference/pcap-format.md`.

**Scope** — a run directory's five pcaps (`mac`, `rlc`, `f1ap`, `e1ap`, `ngap`)
are one logical capture, cross-correlated by epoch timestamp. For a single pcap:
for a deep investigation, widen to the reported run-dir siblings for
cross-protocol correlation; for a narrow question, stay scoped to the file at
hand.

## Efficiency rules (pcap)

- **Never** run `tshark -V` without `-c 1` or a single-frame filter
  (`-Y 'frame.number == N'`). Full verbose dumps blow up context.
- **Caching is automatic** for the helper scripts: `Tshark.iter_fields` of
  `parsers.pcap` keys on the pcap path plus the column set, so re-running the same query is nearly free
  and needs no manual cache bookkeeping. The scripts print `cache: <path> (hit|
  miss)` on stderr — quote that path rather than reconstructing the hash. For a
  *hand-crafted* tshark chain there is no cache; spill it yourself.
- **AppArmor**: on Ubuntu the Canonical AppArmor profile on tshark restricts
  reads to `/tmp`. The helper scripts auto-stage pcaps into the cache dir's
  `pcap-stage/` subfolder — see `reference/pcap-format.md` § AppArmor.
- Scope by the protocol's own UE identifier (`mac-nr.rnti`, `rlc-nr.ueid`, the
  F1AP/NGAP/E1AP UE IDs) — the cross-product of 5 pcaps × many UEs is large.
