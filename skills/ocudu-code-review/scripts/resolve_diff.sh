# Resolve /ocudu-code-review arguments into the git diff command to run.
# Handles the mechanical parts only: argument splitting, base fetch, GitLab MR
# head resolution, three-dot ranges, emptiness. Judgement calls (a dirty tree,
# an MR whose target branch is unknown) are reported, not decided.
#
# Usage: resolve_diff.sh [target] [--base=<ref>] [--fanout]
#        Arguments may also arrive as a single quoted string.
#
# An MR is compared against its real target branch when `glab` can read it,
# and against DEFAULT_BASE otherwise.
#
# Prints on stdout, one KEY=value per line:
#   BASE   ref the tip is compared against; empty for local-only targets
#   TIP    resolved tip ref; empty for `working`/`staged` and explicit ranges
#   CMD    the git command to run
#   DIRTY  1 if the working tree has uncommitted changes
#   EMPTY  1 if CMD produces no changes
#   FILES  files the diff touches
#   LINES  changed lines, insertions plus deletions
#   LINES_NOWS  the same ignoring all whitespace; far below LINES means the
#          diff is mostly reformatting
#   BYTES  size of the diff text
#   BIG    1 when BYTES exceeds BIG_BYTES, i.e. reading the diff whole would
#          cost more context than it is worth
#   FANOUT 1 if --fanout was passed
#   FILE   `<changed-lines> <path>`, largest first; only when BIG=1
#   GROUP  `<n> <path>...`, the fan-out grouping; only when FANOUT=1
#   COMMENT, COMMENTS_FILE, COMMENTS_MORE, COMMENTS_TRUNCATED
#          reviewer threads already on the MR, from mr_comments.py
#
# Then a PLAN block: the branch of the procedure that actually applies, as
# imperative lines. Only the applicable branch is printed, so the caller pays
# no context for the ones that don't.

usage: resolve_diff.sh [target] [--base=<ref>] [--fanout]

Resolves /ocudu-code-review arguments into the git diff command to run, sizes
the diff without printing it, and emits a PLAN for reviewing it.

targets: none (the current branch), `working`, `staged`, a branch or commit
ref, a range `A..B`/`A...B`, a GitLab MR URL. One commit alone: `abc123^..abc123`.

--base=<ref>  compare against <ref>. Default: the MR's target branch when glab
              can read it, else origin/dev.
--fanout      emit GROUP= lines splitting a large diff across subagents.

keys: BASE TIP CMD DIRTY EMPTY FILES LINES LINES_NOWS BYTES BIG FANOUT,
      FILE=<churn> <path> (when BIG=1), GROUP=<n> <path>... (when FANOUT=1),
      COMMENT=/COMMENTS_FILE= (an MR's existing review threads).
