  Requires git, plus network access to `origin` for the base fetch. A GitLab
  MR URL resolves through `origin` (`refs/merge-requests/<iid>/head`), so
  `origin` must point at the same gitlab.com/ocudu project as the MR. An
  authenticated `glab` is optional: with it, an MR is compared against its
  real target branch and its existing review threads are digested so the
  review doesn't repeat them; without it, against `origin/dev` and blind to
  the threads.

# OCUDU Code Review

**Usage:** `/ocudu-code-review [target] [--base=<ref>] [--fanout]`

Defaults: `target` = current branch, `--base` = the MR's target branch else
`origin/dev`. Anything in the argument string that isn't a flag is the
`target`. `--fanout` reviews a large diff through subagents.

## Guidelines

- Find problems; do not fix them. No findings is a valid outcome.
- Do not build or test locally without asking the user first; rely on CI.
- Do not launch other code review skills, or subagents beyond what the PLAN
  says, without asking the user first.

## Step 1 — Resolve and plan

```
"${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/resolve_diff.sh" "$ARGUMENTS"
```

It prints `KEY=value` lines and a `PLAN:` block. Follow the PLAN, then Step 2.
`--help` lists accepted targets and keys.

Never trim diff context below the default three lines.

## Step 2 — Review

Check every hunk against every checklist in:

- [REFERENCE.md](references/REFERENCE.md): correctness, C++ conventions,
  comment style.
- [realtime.md](references/realtime.md): real-time path safety.
- [security.md](references/security.md): untrusted input.

Skip stylistic nits that match no checklist item.

## Step 3 — Report findings

Merge and dedupe any subagent findings first. Each finding has:

- `category` — kebab slug: `correctness`, `memory-safety` (lifetime/UB bugs
  not caused by untrusted input), `untrusted-input`, `realtime-alloc`,
  `realtime-blocking`, `realtime-latency`.
- `failure_scenario` — the concrete inputs/state that lead to the wrong
  outcome.
- `verdict` — `CONFIRMED` when traced end to end, else `PLAUSIBLE`. Drop
  anything weaker.

Rank findings most-severe-first: memory-safety, untrusted-input and real-time,
then correctness. Output, in this order:

1. **Summary**: 1–3 lines on what the change does.
2. **Findings**: one `ReportFindings` call with the full list (empty if none).
   If the tool is unavailable, a markdown table with columns
   `File:Line | Category | Verdict | Summary | Failure scenario`.
3. **`### Conventions`**: convention and comment-style findings, one
   `file:line — issue` per line. Omit if none.
4. **Reviewed**: files and diff range, one line.
